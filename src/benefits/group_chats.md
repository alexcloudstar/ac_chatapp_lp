title: Create new group chats
description:
  ChatApp V2 also offers users the ability to see other users statuses,
  such as online or offline, which are indicated by a green or gray circle
  under their profile picture. Users can also view a list of chat rooms,
  which includes the room\'s image, title, creator, and the last message and
  its sent time. When a new room is created, a default message of "Welcome
  to the chatroom! ⚡️" is automatically sent. Another great feature of
  ChatApp V2 is its real-time messaging capabilities. Users can send
  messages by pressing enter or the send button, and they can also select
  emojis from an emoji picker. Additionally, users can search for rooms and
  edit existing rooms with the same customizations as when they were first
  created.
